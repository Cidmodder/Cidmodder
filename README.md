I've been programming as a hobbist for 10 years now, starting with elder scrolls and fallout mods, to eventually collaborating on some Unity apps before becoming a high school math and science teacher.
I've been teaching for over 10 years and held a variety of leadership roles but never stopped programming, mostly using Unity as my platform of choice and Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
Now I'm looking to make the switch to production where I can use my leadership skills in game development.
