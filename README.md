Most recently, I've been a Math Content Developer designing K - 5 math lessons for iPad and desktop using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React.
I've been programming as a hobbist for 10 years now, starting with elder scrolls and fallout mods, to eventually collaborating on some Unity apps before becoming a high school math and science teacher.
I've been teaching for over 10 years and held a variety of leadership roles but never stopped programming, mostly using Unity as my platform of choice and Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
