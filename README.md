I've been programming as a hobbist for 10 years now, starting with elder scrolls and fallout mods, to eventually collaborating on some Unity apps before becoming a high school math and science teacher.
I've been teaching for over 10 years and held a variet of leadership roles but never stopped programming, mostly using Unity as my platform of choice.
Now I'm looking to make the switch to IT through codecademy's full stack developer course.
